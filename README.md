# Push Swap

A sorting algorithm for inputed numbers.

## 1. Description

The objective of **push_swap** is to develop a sorting algorithm that uses a limited set of stack-based operations to sort a list of integers with the fewest moves possible.
The program utilizes two (2) stacks, **Stack A** and **Stack B**, applying specific [operations](## Operations)to arrange numbers in ascending order. The goal is to optimize the number of operations, making the program efficient and meeting the performance benchmarks.
